## Exploratory Analysis

```{r}

#read in the data

library(data.table)
two <- data.table::fread(file.path('C:/Users/ellya/OneDrive/Desktop/PM566labs/2002_2.5PM_data.csv'),
                  header = TRUE, sep = ',')

ttwo <- data.table::fread(file.path('C:/Users/ellya/OneDrive/Desktop/PM566labs/2022_2.5PM_data.csv'),
                  header = TRUE, sep = ',')

#Check the dimenstions, headers, and footers

dim(two)
dim(ttwo)
head(two)
tail(two)
head(ttwo)
tail(ttwo)

#quick look at the variables

str(two)
str(ttwo)

#closer look at key variables
summary(two$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`)
head(two[order(two$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`), ])
tail(two[order(two$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`), ])
ttwo <- ttwo[ttwo$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration` > 0, ]
summary(ttwo$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`)
head(ttwo[order(ttwo$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`), ])
tail(ttwo[order(ttwo$`Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration`), ])
dim(ttwo)

```

When looking more closely at the Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration variable in both data sets, I noticed that the 2022 data set had PM2.5 values less than 0, which shouldn't be possible. I removed these observations from the data. Additionally, both data sets have maximum PM 2.5 values that are much higher than the 3rd quartile values. However, I could not find anything online that would prompt me to remove these high observations. There are 15976 observations for the 2002 data and the mean Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration is 16.12. For the 2022 data, after removing the observations below zero, there are 59413 observations and the mean Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration is 8.48. As the means are higher than the medians for both data sets, the data seems to be skewed right.
